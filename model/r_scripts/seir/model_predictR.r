#' This function is used to predict the total reported as well as unreported case counts, total recovered and total deaths
#'
#' @param data  (Mandatory) input : Mainly the training dataset. If the model is Multinomial then the data matrix should contain 3 columns namely Confirmed,Recovered and Death, while if the model is Poisson or Binomial, then the data should contain only one column namely Confirmed. Please see that the names of the colums are maintained.
#' @param data_init (Mandatory) This is the initial data values that should be provided by the user which is a six size length vector. The first entry should contain the Total Confirmed, Total Recovered ,Total Death , Daily Confirmed ,Daily Recovered and Daily Death for the Starting Date. If the starting total confirmed is 0 , please replace it by 1.
#' @param init_pars  = NULL( default) . Else the user can give a user input initial paramters which should consist of the initial values of the time varying beta , proportion of testing for the different periods.
#' @param N (Mandatory) : The population size.
#' @param plot =TRUE . If estimate = FALSE , this will give two plots , one is the panel plot for total cases, total recovered, total death and total confirmed if the model is Multinomial , else it will give only a plot for total confirmed when the model is binomial or poisson and the second plot is the plot of untested, false negative and reported cases. And when estimate=  TRUE , then it will give two other plots along with the previous two plots. One is the box plot for basic reproduction number and the other one is the trace plot for the convergence of the mcmc paramters.
#' @param T_predict  It is the no of days that we want to predict after the train period. The value of T_predict should be atleast greater than equal to  the no of rows for the data_test.
#' @param period_start The total time period is divided into small periods depending on the lockdowm measures imposed by the goverment. So this is a vector consisting of the start dates for the different time periods.
#' @param estimate = TRUE (default) If it is TRUE then it will run the MCMC algorithm to estimate the parameters. Else if it is FALSE then the user needs to give input the paramter values in the pars argument.
#' @param pars = NULL (default) .If estimate = FALSE, then the user need to give input the paramter estimates .
#' @param data_test = NULL ( default). Else the person needs to give to give the test data for comparing with the model estimates.
#' @param auto.initialize = TRUE(default) This is the option for using a mle based initial parameter.
#' @param ... arguments passed to the function model_estimateR, model_initializeR and model_plotR which is used for the initializing the parameters. The parameters are described below:
#'            \itemize{
#'                 \item{"niter"}{= 1e5 (default)  No of iteration for the MCMC metropolis hasting algorithm.}
#'                 \item{"BurnIn"}{ = 5e4 (default) This is the Burn-In Period for the MCMC algorithm}
#'                 \item{"model"} {= Multinomial(DEFAULT) This is the likelihood function that will be used. There are three options available namely Multinomial, Poisson and Binomial.}
#'                 \item{"alpha_p"}{= 0.5 (default) It is defined as the ratio of rate of spread of infection by tested positive patients to that by false negatives. We have taken $\alpha_p < 1$ as patients who are tested positive are subjected to quarantine where the chance of spreading the disease is less than that of false negative patients who are mostly unaware of their infectious nature. So, false negative individuals continue to spread the disease freely at a higher rate than tested positive individuals. }
#'                 \item{"alpha_u"}{= 0.7 (default) It is defined as the  scaling factor for the rate of spread of infection by untested individuals. $\alpha_u$ is assumed to be < 1 as U mostly consists of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases who are known to spread the disease at a much lower rate than those with higher levels of symptoms.}
#'                 \item{"beta_1 }{= 0.6 (default) . It is the scaling factor for rate of recovery  for untested individuals .  $\beta_1$ is  assumed to be less than 1.  The condition of Untested individuals is not so severe as they consists of mostly asymptomatic people. So, they are assumed to recover faster than the Current Positive Ones. }
#'                 \item{"beta_2"}{= 0.7 (default) . It is the inverse of the scaling factor for rate of recovery  for false negative individuals .  $\beta_2$ is assumed to be less than 1. It is assumed that the recovery rate is slower than the detected ones for the False Negative ones because they are not getting any hospital treatments. }
#'                 \item{"delta_1}{= 0.3 (default) It is the scaling factor for death rate for undetected individuals .  $\delta_1 $ is assumed to be less than 1. Similarly  for the Untested ones, the death rate is taken to be lesser because they are mostly asymptomatic. So, their probability of dying is much less.}
#'                 \item{"delta_2"}{= 0.7 (default). It is the inverse of  the scaling factor for death rate for false negative individuals . $\delta_2$ is assumed to be less than 1. Same as before, the death rate for False Negative ones are assumed to be higher than the Current detected Positive as they are not receiving proper treatment.}
#'                 \item{"lambda"}{=  1 / (66.26 * 365)(default) Natural birth  rate. The value given here as the default value is the world's common birth  rate.}
#'                 \item{"mu"}{=  1 / (66.26 * 365)(default) Natural  death rates. This is assumed to be equal with natural birth rate for the sake of simplicity.}
#'                 \item{"D_e"}{= 5.2 (default) Incubation period .}
#'                 \item{"Dr"}{= 17.8 (default) Mean days till recovery for positive individuals.}
#'                 \item{"f"}{=0.15 (default) False negative probability of RT-PCR test.}
#'                 \item{"mCFR"}{= NULL (It is calculated from the data  by default) It is defined as the ratio of the total reported deceased cases and the total removed cases  till that day.}
#'                 \item{"init.exposed.ratio "}{= 3 (default) This is the scaling factor for the calculation of the initial number of exposed people from the sum of the initial number of unreported, repoted people.}
#'                 \item{"init.confirmed.ratio"}{= 0.15 (default) This is the initial value of the probability of being tested.}
#'                 \item{"opt_num"}{= 100 (default) The number of times an user wants to run the mle optimization before deciding on the best initial parameter.}
#'                 \item{"trace_plot.common_axis"}{=FALSE(Default) This will give the trace plot for  the convergence of the mcmc estimated time varying parameters}
#'                 \item{"save plot"}{=TRUE (Default) It is the option for saving the plots in the directory folder.}
